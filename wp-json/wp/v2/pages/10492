In accordance with them, we need to inform you about the cookies we use and obtain your consent when using certain types of cookies namely Functional, Performance, Analytical and Advertising Cookies.<\/p>\r\n<h3><strong>What are cookies?<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<p>Cookies are small files with configuration information that are stored on your device. Cookies can be divided into the following two broad categories:<\/p>\r\n<p>\u25cf <em><strong>Technically necessary cookies (Essential)<\/strong><\/em><br \/>Technically necessary cookies are required for our website to function properly; they enable you to navigate our website efficiently and use its functional features. An example of this is, the reminder of recently performed actions (e.g., entered text) when you return to a page within the same session.<\/p>\r\n<p>\u25cf <em><strong>Technically non-essential cookies (Performance, Functional, Analytical, Advertising)<\/strong><\/em><br \/>Technically non-essential cookies are not necessary for the proper functioning of our website, but they enable us to improve the content of our website, compile statistics for internal market analysis purposes, provide you with a more personalised online experience or provide additional features. In particular we use analytical cookies.<\/p>\r\n<p>Analytical cookies are used by third parties. These cookies allow third parties to recognize that you have visited our website. We and our third-party providers may also combine information obtained from these cookies with Personal Information available from other sources, including data collected about you when you use other websites and data collected about you when you are offline, whether on our website or data maintained by the third-party provider.<\/p>\r\n<p>Within the described categories, different types of cookies are used and these can be subdivided into:<\/p>\r\n<p>\u25cf <em><strong>Session cookies<\/strong><\/em><br \/>While you are active on a website, a session cookie is temporarily stored in your computer&#8217;s memory, which stores a session identifier, for example, to prevent you from having to log in again each time you change pages. Session cookies are deleted when you log out or lose their validity once their session has automatically expired.<\/p>\r\n<p>\u25cf <em><strong>Permanent or persistent cookies<\/strong><\/em><br \/>A persistent or protocol cookie stores a file on your computer for the period of time specified in the expiration date. These cookies allow websites to remember your information and settings the next time you visit. This results in faster and more convenient access, as you do not have to set your language preferences for our portal again, for example. When the expiration date passes, the cookie is automatically deleted when you visit the website that generated it.<\/p>\r\n<p>\u25cf <em><strong>Third-party cookies<\/strong><\/em><br \/>Third-party cookies come from providers other than the website operator. For example, they may be used to collect information for advertising, custom content, and web statistics.<\/p>\r\n<h3><strong>The cookies we use<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<p>Below are the non-essential cookies our website uses.
