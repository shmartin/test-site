Specifically, this requires the IP address of your computer, Date and time of access, Name and URL of the accessed file, Browser used, Number of bytes transferred, Status of the page retrieval, Session ID, Referrer URL.<\/p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Hosting<\/strong><\/em> <br \/>To provide our website, we use the services of <strong>Hostinger<\/strong> who process all data to be processed in connection with the operation of our website on our behalf. The legal basis for the data processing is our legitimate interest in providing our website.<\/p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Provision of the Shop<\/strong><\/em><br \/>We also use the shop system of WooCommerce by <strong>Automattic<\/strong>. All data collected in our shop is processed on Automattic`s global servers.

This means that all content and texts submitted to us is transferred to WordPress. This represents a legitimate interest.<\/p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Content Delivery Network<\/strong><\/em> <br \/>We also use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to distribute our online content. Our CDN is a network of regionally distributed servers operated by our technical service providers that are interconnected via the Internet. When you visit our website, your device&#8217;s browser transmits information to these service providers, which is collected in corresponding server log files. The server log files are usually anonymized and then transmitted without personal reference. The server log files include in particular a) information on the browser and operating system used, b) the previously visited pages (so-called referral URL), c) the IP address of the device used, d) the name of the Internet provider, and v) the date, time of all page views including the amount of data transferred. The legal basis for the processing is our legitimate interest.<\/p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Cookies<\/strong><\/em><br \/>We use so-called cookies on our website. Cookies are pieces of information that are transmitted from our web server or third-party web servers to your web browser and stored there for later retrieval. Cookies may be small files or other types of information storage. There are different types of cookies: a) Essential Cookies. Essential cookies are cookies to provide a correct and user-friendly website; and b) Non-essential Cookies. Non-essential Cookies are any cookies that do not fall within the definition of essential cookies, such as cookies used to analyse your behaviour on a website (\u201canalytical\u201d cookies) or cookies used to display advertisements to you (\u201cadvertising\u201d cookies).<\/p>\r\n<p>As set out in the UK`s Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (\u201cPECR\u201d) and the EU`s Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive (\u201cPECD\u201d), we need to obtain consent for the use of Non-essential Cookies. For further information on the cookies we use, please refer to our Cookie Policy. The legal basis for processing is our legitimate interest and your consent.<\/p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Cookie consent<\/strong><\/em> <br \/>Our website uses a so-called cookie consent tool to obtain your consent to the storage of cookies and to document this consent. When you enter our website, the following Personal Data is transferred to us: a) Your consent(s) or revocation of your consent(s); b) Your IP address; c) Information about your browser; d) Information about your device; e) Time of your visit to the website. The basis for processing is our legitimate interest and your consent.<\/p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Google Fonts<\/strong><\/em><br \/>We integrate the fonts of the provider <strong>Google LLC<\/strong>, whereby the user&#8217;s data is used solely for the purpose of displaying the fonts in the user&#8217;s browser. The integration is based on my legitimate interest in a technically secure, maintenance-free and efficient use of fonts, their uniform display and taking into account possible licensing restrictions for their integration. The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interest.<\/p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Google Maps<\/strong><\/em><br \/>Our website uses Google Maps API to visually display geographical information. When using Google Maps, Google also collects, processes and uses data about visitors&#8217; use of the map functions. You can find more information about data processing by Google in the Google privacy policy. There you can also change your personal privacy settings in the Privacy Centre. The integration of Google Maps represents a legitimate interest.<\/p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Google Tag Manager<\/strong><\/em> <br \/>We use Google Tag Manager by <strong>Google LLC<\/strong> which allows website tags to be managed via an interface. The Google Tag Manager only implements tags. No cookies are set, and no Personal Data is collected. Google Tag Manager triggers other tags that may collect data but does not itself access this data. The legal basis for using Google Tag Manager is our legitimate interest.<\/p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Google reCAPTCHA<\/strong><\/em><br \/>We also use Google`s reCAPTCHA from <strong>Google LLC<\/strong> to check whether data input is made by a human being or by an automated program. For this purpose, reCAPTCHA analyses the behaviour of the website visitor on the basis of various characteristics. This analysis begins automatically as soon as the website visitor enters the website. The legal basis for using reCAPTCHA is our legitimate interest.<\/p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Jetpack<\/strong><\/em> <br \/>We have integrated Jetpack by <strong>Automattic<\/strong> on our website. Jetpack is a WordPress plug-in that offers additional functions to the operator of a website built on WordPress. Among other things, Jetpack allows the website operator to keep track of visitors to the site. By displaying related posts and publications or the possibility to share content on the page, it is also possible to increase the number of visitors. In addition, security functions are integrated into Jetpack so that a website using Jetpack is better protected against brute force attacks. Jetpack also optimises and speeds up the loading of images integrated on the website.<\/p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Google Analytics<\/strong><\/em><br \/>We use Google Analytics provided by <em><strong>Google LLC<\/strong><\/em>, on our website.

Where your consent is implied, it is on the basis that you would have a reasonable expectation of receiving a marketing communication based on your interactions or contractual relationship with us.<\/p>\r\n<p>Direct Marketing generally takes the form of e-mail but may also include other less traditional or emerging channels.
